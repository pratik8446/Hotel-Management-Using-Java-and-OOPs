I just created a simple Hotel menu card using Java and OOPs concept. Using my knowledge in oops concept I able to create a simple menu card.
In this card I gave two options which is veg and non veg , In that there are several dishesh and there prices.
After selecting dishesh, it will count the money which you purchase and make the total.
